# Intro_to_Java
Made in CS 163 introduction to Java programming course.


Projects:

------------------------These were made weekly as homework assignments for CS163-----------------------------------

- P1: Practice printing statements and doing basic computations using different primitive types.
- P2: Using scanners, and more practice with computations.
- P3: Reworking P2 to use interfaces and methods.
- P4: Implementing a gui that functions as a calculator, including use of switch statements and wrapper classes.
- P5: Using scanners, switch statements, and if/else loops to calculate tax based on user input of salary, exemptions, interest, and gains.
- P6: Implementing a gui, and using nested for loops and if/else statements to solve given mazes.
- P7: Writing methods to complete tasks, with parameters and returns of arrays.


Labs:

----------------------------These were made bi-weekly during labs for CS163---------------------------------------

- Variables: Practice initializing  and declaring primitive variables, printf statements, incrementation, and integer math.
- Exp: Practice using scanners, and operator precedence to solve quadratic eqaution based on user input of integers.
- Methods: Using methods to perform various computations.
- Convert: Writing methods bodies for an implemented interface.
- Comparisons: Practice using switches, booleans, and switch statements.
- Strings: Practice declaring and initializing strings, and using string methods.
- Loops: Using for and while loops within the bodies of methods.
- Interpret: Predicting parameter and return types of given methods.
- ArrayPractice: Practice initiating and declaring arrays, and using array methods.
